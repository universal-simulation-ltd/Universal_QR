// Handing a finished file to the user — the one step that is genuinely

// ⚠️ In a Capacitor WKWebView the `download` attribute is IGNORED. Not
// refused, not errored: the anchor is clicked, nothing happens, and no
// exception reaches the console. So the browser path below cannot be the only
// one, or every export button in the app is dead on iOS while looking fine in
// every test that runs in a real browser.
//
// iOS expects the share sheet instead, which is also what someone on a phone
// actually wants — Save to Files, Save to Photos, or straight into a message.
// There is no "Downloads folder" on the device to save to.
//
// The plugins are imported dynamically so they never reach the web bundle,
// which has a working path of its own and would otherwise pay for code that
// can only no-op in a browser. Same reasoning as `nativeOpen.ts` in
// Universal PDF.
