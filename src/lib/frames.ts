// Shaped QR codes — a circle, a hexagon, a star instead of the usual square
// plate.
//
// ⚠️ The one rule this file exists to keep: **the code itself is never
// clipped.** A QR is only readable if every module and its quiet zone are
// present, so the shape can only ever be drawn *around or behind* the code. The
// code is rendered smaller and centred inside the largest square that fits
// within the shape; the shape is what gets drawn around it. Anything that
// trims the silhouette out of the modules produces a picture of a QR code, not
// a QR code.
//
// The one arrangement that is not a plate is `StarPlacement: 'behind'`, and it
// keeps the same rule from the other side: the star is drawn UNDER a code that
// covers its notches, so the code is complete and the star is what gets
// overlapped. Nothing is clipped there either.
//
// Both the canvas renderer and the SVG exporter draw from the SAME polygon
// returned by `framePolygon`, deliberately — including for the circle and the
// rounded square, where SVG could express a truer curve with an arc. A 256-gon
// circle is visually exact at these sizes (sub-pixel sagitta at 512 px) and
// having one source of geometry means the PNG and the SVG cannot disagree,
// which is the failure this app has no way to notice.
