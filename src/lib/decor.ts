// Plate decoration — the marks that fill the space a shaped plate leaves around
// the code, so the shape reads as designed rather than as a square code sitting
// on a round background.
//
// WHAT THIS IS NOT. The look people point at (WeChat Mini Program codes, and
// branded circular codes generally) sometimes encodes its data in radial arcs.
// That is a different symbology. A QR's modules sit on a fixed square grid and
// moving them radially stops it decoding, so this cannot be that: the code
// stays a square QR and these are DECORATION drawn around it. Every mark is
// generated outside the code's own square boundary at its angle (innerAt), plus
// a margin, so nothing can land on a module or in its quiet zone.
//
// A shaped plate has no room for this on its own. The largest square inscribed
// in a circle touches it at all four corners, so decoration only exists if the
// code is made smaller: DECOR_CODE_SCALE. That is a real trade — a smaller code
// must be exported larger to stay scannable — which is why decoration is an
// option the user turns on, not something that happens to a shape they already
// chose. frameSizeNote reports the resulting code size either way.
//
// The geometry is generated ONCE here and consumed by both the canvas renderer
// and the SVG exporter, for the same reason framePolygon is: the PNG and the
// SVG must not disagree, and this app has no way to notice if they do. It is
// deterministic — a seeded PRNG, never Math.random — so a given size always
// draws the same marks. Reshuffling per render would flicker in the live
// preview and make the PNG and the SVG of "the same" code different pictures.
