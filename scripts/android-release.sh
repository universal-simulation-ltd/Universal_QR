# Output: android/app/build/outputs/bundle/release/Universal-QR-<version>-<code>.aab
#
# ⚠️ Run `npm run cap:sync` first, or the bundle carries the web assets from
# the last sync rather than your current build. This script does not sync,
# because syncing silently is how you ship yesterday's app.
#
# ⚠️ The version comes from package.json: build.gradle derives versionName and
# versionCode (major*10000 + minor*100 + patch) from it. Bump it before every
# upload — Play refuses a code it has already seen, permanently, even from a
# deleted draft — then `npm run sync:ios-version` so iOS matches.
#
# ⚠️ It signs with UNIVERSAL PDF's upload key, not a QR one, and NOT through
# .github/workflows/android-release.yml. Every suite app shares PDF's Play
# app-signing key so they can share the Android sign-in, and Play then expects
# PDF's upload key too: Ergo tried its own and the upload was refused as
# "signed with the wrong key" (2026-09-15). Never make another key.
# ⚠️ Except that QR itself did NOT end up with PDF's app-signing key: Play gave
# it a Google-generated one (FA:57:01…), and 1.0.0 went live before anyone
# noticed. Since 1.0.1 QR is out of the shared sign-in on Android (see the top
# of android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml). The upload key above is still
# the one Play expects.
#
# The upload key lives outside the repo, in ~/.unisim-keys (backed up to the
# ProtonDrive vault, "0. VAULT/Key Stores/"). Google re-signs what reaches users
# with its own app-signing key (Play App Signing), so a lost upload key can be
# reset through Play support, but that takes days.
